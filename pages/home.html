                EI is one of my major projects, it includes 90% of what I enjoy doing; Minecraft, Web Development and Media, and has one of the 
                best teams I have ever worked in. We love to build on a massive scale, making giant structures and storylines, 
                we hope to open later next year, but we will see.
                <br><br>
                After I left Sapphire Adventures, I was really looking for a place to call home, I reached out to a bunch of servers to basically no avail. 
                When I gave up almost all hope, I messaged Jacob (supapap), we had kind of worked together on Sapphire and knew of each other and what our skills were.
                I asked him if he wanted help with any web development in Kw6Craft (his server at the time) and at this point, not known to me, Jacob was wanting to leave
                and start his own server, perfect timing. The first couple of weeks was a massive rush for the whole team he had recruited, and felt like we we're on to something
                big and amazing. The server now is mainly ran by him, me and shrake, and we are having a blast! I honestly am so proud of what
                we've managed to accomplish so far and I am really looking forward to the future, check out the website for pics down below.
                <br><br>
                Anyway, enough about the story, lets talk about the website.
                <br>
                The whole thing is built on a Debian 10 machine from Meloncube and runs like a dream, it handles Minecraft so nicely with what we need in terms
                of performance and speed. It is also a linux environment so it runs <a class="text-light" onclick="project(2)">Cloud Core</a> very well and has massive
                expandability when paired with the website. Its currently running PHP, MySQL & Bootstrap 5, the login system is completely based off Discord, which makes
                logging in so much easier and completely latches on to your Discord profile, removing the need to store any passwords. It does come with it's trade-offs
                though. Discord have a normal API rate-limit and naturally you don't want to spam Discord's API every time a logged-in user visits the site. To combat
                this I simply stored Discord JSON data inside of a database table and treated it like a cache, worked like a charm first try. Some other interesting 
                aspects is that the staff integration is completely built into the site, meaning it will contact the server and try to look up a user's groups and give
                them access to certain pages. This took me ages to figure out and hours staring at the LuckPerms database, but it all worked out. If a user has a staff
                role, they use staff only pages like they would use any other page, instead of having it on for instance a staff panel or a separate website. Centralize!
